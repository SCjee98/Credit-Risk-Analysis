# Data Science and Machine Learning Portfolio

## Overview
This repository showcases a collection of data science and machine learning projects I have worked on. It includes notebooks and scripts that demonstrate my skills in exploratory data analysis, machine learning model development, and data visualization.

## Project Contents

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Notebook**: `EDA.ipynb`
- **Description**: This notebook provides a comprehensive exploratory data analysis of a dataset. Key tasks include:
  - Importing Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
  - Loading Data: Loading a dataset from a CSV file (`loan.csv`)
  - Basic Statistics: Calculating and displaying basic statistical metrics of the dataset
  - Missing Values Analysis: Checking for missing values in the dataset

### 2. Machine Learning Models
- **Notebook**: `ML_Models.ipynb`
- **Description**: This notebook demonstrates the development and evaluation of various machine learning models. Key tasks include:
  - Importing Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn
  - Loading Data: Loading the dataset (`loan.csv`)
  - Data Preprocessing: Encoding categorical variables, standardizing features, and splitting the data into training and testing sets
  - Feature Selection: Using Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) with a logistic regression model to select the top 10 features
  - Hyperparameter Tuning: Using GridSearchCV to tune hyperparameters for the logistic regression model
  - Model Training and Evaluation: Training the logistic regression model and evaluating its performance

## Installation
To run these notebooks, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
